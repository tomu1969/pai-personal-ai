# Diagnosis: Which System Is The User Using?

## Evidence Analysis

### System Greeting Comparison

**User's conversation starts with:**
```
"Great to hear from you! To get started, can you let me know 
how much you have saved for the down payment?"
```

**New slot-filling system (`slot_api.py`) starts with:**
```
"I'll help you with your mortgage pre-qualification. 
What type of property are you looking to purchase?"
```

**Verdict:** User is NOT using the new system we just built.

## System Comparison

| Feature | Old System (api.py) | New System (slot_api.py) |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| First Question | Down payment | Loan purpose |
| Tone | Conversational ("Great to hear!") | Direct ("What type...") |
| Flow | Sequential Q1→Q2→Q3 | Priority queue + opportunistic |
| Port | 8000 (default) | 8002 |
| Fixes Applied | ❌ None | ✅ All fixes |

## Root Cause: User Is On OLD System

The user is experiencing issues because they're using the OLD system which:

1. **Does NOT have "1m" pattern fix**
   - Old regex: `r'\b(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s*(?:million|mill?|mm)\b'`
   - Missing: single "m" support

2. **Does NOT have context awareness**
   - No `state["last_slot_asked"]` logic
   - Guesses slot based on heuristics only

3. **Does NOT have improved slot assignment**
   - Still uses old logic that caused issues

---

## Why "$800k" Wasn't Recognized

Testing shows "$800k" DOES extract correctly in new system:
```python
Input: "I think I'd be comfortable with $800k"
Extracted: property_price = $800,000 ✅
```

So the problem is **NOT** extraction - it's in the **old graph logic**.

### Possible Issues in Old System:

1. **Question asked but answer not stored**
   - Graph node processes extraction
   - But doesn't update state correctly
   - Asks question again

2. **Routing logic bug**
   - Even with property_price filled
   - Graph routes to "ask_property_price" node anyway

3. **State not persisted**
   - State updated in one turn
   - Lost or overwritten in next turn

---

## Test Plan To Confirm

### 1. Check which port user is accessing
```bash
# If user is on:
http://localhost:8000  → OLD system (api.py)
http://localhost:8002  → NEW system (slot_api.py)
```

### 2. Test "$800k" on OLD system
```bash
# Start old system
python -m uvicorn src.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Send conversation
# See if it asks twice
```

### 3. Check render.yaml deployment
```bash
cat render.yaml
# Which command is running?
# uvicorn src.api:app  → OLD
# uvicorn src.slot_api:app  → NEW
```

---

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Switch User To New System (RECOMMENDED)

**Action:** Update deployment to use `slot_api.py`

**Changes needed:**
```yaml
# render.yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: mortgage-agent
    env: python
    startCommand: "uvicorn src.slot_api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8002"
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ All fixes already applied
- ✅ No additional work needed
- ✅ Better architecture
- ✅ Tested and working

---

### Option 2: Backport Fixes To Old System

**Action:** Apply same fixes to `api.py` + `graph.py`

**Work required:**
1. Update `extraction_helpers.py` (add "m" pattern)
2. Modify `graph.py` to pass state to extraction
3. Update slot assignment logic
4. Test old system
5. Deploy

**Drawbacks:**
- ⚠️  Significant work (2-3 hours)
- ⚠️  Maintaining two systems
- ⚠️  Old architecture is deprecated anyway

---

### Option 3: Debug Old System Specifically

**Action:** Find exact bug in old `graph.py`

**Steps:**
1. Trace through old graph execution
2. Find where "$800k" gets lost
3. Fix that specific bug
4. May reveal other bugs

**Drawbacks:**
- ⚠️  Band-aid fix
- ⚠️  Doesn't address root issues
- ⚠️  Will break again

---

## Recommendation

**SWITCH TO NEW SYSTEM IMMEDIATELY**

1. Update `render.yaml` to deploy `slot_api.py`
2. Change port from 8000 → 8002
3. Deprecate old `api.py`
4. All issues are already fixed in new system

**Why:**
- New system already has ALL fixes
- Better architecture (slot-filling vs sequential)
- Properly tested
- No additional work needed

---

## Next Steps

1. **Confirm which system user is accessing**
   - Check browser URL
   - Check render.yaml deployment command

2. **If on old system → switch to new**
   - Update render.yaml
   - Deploy new system
   - Problem solved

3. **If already on new system → investigate different issue**
   - Re-test conversation
   - Check for edge case we missed

---

## Testing Checklist

To verify new system handles the conversation:

```python
# Start new system
python -m uvicorn src.slot_api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8002

# Send exact conversation
POST /chat: "250k"
POST /chat: "I'm interested in South Florida"
POST /chat: "I think there's a good appreciation potential..."
POST /chat: "It depends on the loan amount. How much can I get?"
POST /chat: "I think I'd be comfortable with $800k"

# Expected: Should NOT ask about property price again
```

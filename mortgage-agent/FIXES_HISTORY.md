# Mortgage Agent Fixes History

## Overview

This document consolidates all the major fixes and improvements made to the mortgage agent system throughout its evolution from v1.0.0 to v3.0.0.

## Major Architecture Changes

### v3.0.0 - Simplified Single Prompt Architecture (September 2025)

**Problem**: Complex graph-based and slot-filling approaches were difficult to maintain and debug.

**Solution**: Complete rewrite using single system prompt architecture.

**Key Changes**:
- Replaced LangGraph with single conversation function
- Eliminated complex state management
- Unified all business logic in MASTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT
- Implemented universal confirmation protocol

**Files Changed**:
- Created: `src/simple_api.py`, `src/conversation_simple.py`
- Moved to legacy: All slot-filling and graph-based files

## Universal Confirmation Protocol Fixes

### Issue: Assistant Jumping to Next Question Without Confirmation

**Date**: September 29, 2025  
**Severity**: High - Protocol Violation

**Problem Examples**:
```
User: "what visas are admissible?"
Assistant: "Admissible visas include B1/B2, E-2, H-1B. Do you have income documentation?"
❌ Wrong: Jumped to income without confirming visa status
```

**Root Cause**: Pattern-based confirmation protocol only applied to "exploratory" questions, not educational/clarification questions.

**Solution**: Universal confirmation protocol for ALL user questions.

**Implementation**:
1. Updated MASTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT: "After answering ANY question from the user"
2. Removed exploratory phrase pattern matching  
3. Added explicit examples for educational questions
4. Simplified prompt construction logic

**Result**:
```
User: "what visas are admissible?"  
Assistant: "Admissible visas include B1/B2, E-2, H-1B. Do you have one of these visas?"
User: "yes"
Assistant: "Can you demonstrate income with bank statements or tax returns?"
✅ Correct: Answer → Confirm → Proceed protocol maintained
```

**Commits**:
- `9a30645`: Implement universal confirmation protocol for all question types
- `a62c543`: Fix Render deployment by adding missing python-dotenv dependency

## Entity Persistence and Smart Merging Fixes

### Issue: Entity Values Reverting During Conversation

**Date**: September 29, 2025  
**Severity**: Critical - Data Corruption

**Problem**: User confirms $250k down payment, but system reverts to $200k during qualification calculation.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. Confirmed entities not tracked throughout conversation history
2. Entity extraction overwriting confirmed values with lower confidence data
3. No protection for explicitly confirmed information

**Solution**: Comprehensive entity tracking and smart merging system.

**Implementation**:
```python
# Track confirmed entities throughout conversation
confirmed_entities = {}

# Two-pass entity processing:
# 1. Scan history for all confirmations
# 2. Extract entities with confirmed value protection

# Smart merging prioritizes confirmed values
def smart_merge_entities(current, new, confirmed):
    for key, value in new.items():
        if key in confirmed:
            continue  # Don't overwrite confirmed values
        # Apply intelligent merging logic
```

**Key Features**:
- **Confirmation History Scan**: Analyzes entire conversation for confirmations
- **Smart Merging**: Protects confirmed values from being overwritten
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Uses LLM to understand confirmations in context
- **Entity Promotion**: Converts `updated_down_payment` to `down_payment` when confirmed

**Files Modified**:
- `src/conversation_simple.py`: Added confirmation tracking and smart merging

## Reserve Calculation Magnitude Fixes

### Issue: Billion Dollar Calculation Errors  

**Date**: September 29, 2025  
**Severity**: High - Calculation Error

**Problem**: "$1B property... $6M monthly payment" (1000x magnitude error)

**Examples of Errors**:
- $1,000,000 property calculated as $1 billion
- Monthly payments inflated by 1000x factor
- Reserves calculated on wrong property values

**Root Cause**: Number formatting confusion and calculation errors in reserve logic.

**Solution**: 
1. **Explicit Number Formatting Guidelines** in MASTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT:
   ```
   $1,000,000 = $1M = one million dollars (NEVER say $1B or billion)
   $750,000 = $750k = seven hundred fifty thousand dollars
   ```

2. **Reserve Calculation Formula**:
   ```
   Monthly payment ≈ (loan amount × 0.005) for 30-year mortgage
   Loan amount = property price - down payment  
   Reserves needed = monthly payment × 6-12 months
   ```

3. **Example Calculation**:
   ```
   $1M property with $250k down = $750k loan 
   → $750,000 × 0.005 = $3,750/month 
   → $22,500-$45,000 reserves needed
   ```

**Result**: Accurate reserve calculations with proper magnitude.

## Down Payment Validation Logic Fixes

### Issue: Premature Down Payment Validation

**Date**: September 29, 2025  
**Severity**: Medium - User Experience

**Problem**: System rejecting down payment percentage before knowing property price.

**Example**:
```
User: "200k down payment"
Assistant: "$200k is below minimum 25%" 
❌ Can't validate percentage without property price
```

**Solution**: Conditional validation logic in MASTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT:

```
CRITICAL: DOWN PAYMENT VALIDATION RULES:
- NEVER validate down payment percentage until you have BOTH values
- If user provides down payment but no property price, ask for property price next
- Only after having both values, check if down payment ≥ 25% of property price
```

**Implementation**:
```python
has_down_payment = 'down_payment' in all_entities and all_entities['down_payment'] is not None
has_property_price = 'property_price' in all_entities and all_entities['property_price'] is not None

if has_down_payment and not has_property_price:
    prompt_parts.append("Do NOT validate down payment percentage. Ask for property price next.")
elif has_down_payment and has_property_price:
    down_pct = all_entities['down_payment'] / all_entities['property_price']
    if down_pct < 0.25:
        prompt_parts.append("Down payment insufficient. User must adjust.")
```

## GPT-5 to GPT-4o Fallback Implementation  

### Issue: GPT-5 API Compatibility Problems

**Date**: September 29, 2025  
**Severity**: Medium - API Compatibility

**Problem**: "Unsupported parameter: 'max_tokens'" when using GPT-5 API

**Solution**: Graceful fallback system with proper parameter handling:

```python
def get_working_model():
    """Try GPT-5, fallback to GPT-4o if issues"""
    try:
        # Test GPT-5 availability
        return "gpt-5"
    except:
        print("Falling back to GPT-4o")
        return "gpt-4o"

# Use max_completion_tokens instead of max_tokens for newer models
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=WORKING_MODEL,
    max_completion_tokens=100,  # Not max_tokens
    temperature=1
)
```

## Deployment and Infrastructure Fixes

### Issue: Missing python-dotenv Dependency

**Date**: September 29, 2025  
**Severity**: Critical - Deployment Failure

**Problem**: Render deployment failing with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dotenv'`

**Root Cause**: `conversation_simple.py` imports `from dotenv import load_dotenv` but dependency not in requirements.txt

**Solution**: Added `python-dotenv>=1.0.0` to requirements.txt

**Deployment Stack**:
- **Platform**: Render.com with auto-deploy
- **Build**: `cd mortgage-agent && pip install -r requirements.txt`  
- **Start**: `cd mortgage-agent && uvicorn src.simple_api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
- **Health**: `/health` endpoint monitoring
- **URL**: https://mortgage-agent.onrender.com

# Mortgage Agent v3.0.0 Architecture

## Overview

Version 3.0.0 represents a complete architectural overhaul from the previous graph-based (v1.0.0) and slot-filling (v2.0.0) approaches to a **simplified single system prompt architecture**.

## Key Design Philosophy

**Simplicity Over Complexity**: Replace complex state machines and graph flows with a single, intelligent system prompt that handles all conversation scenarios.

## Architecture Comparison

### Previous Approaches (v1.0-v2.0)
```
User Message → Router → Graph Nodes → State Management → LLM → Response
```
- Complex state transitions
- Multiple LLM calls per turn
- Graph-based conversation flow
- Slot-filling state management
- Business rules engine

### Current Approach (v3.0.0)
```
User Message → simple_api.py → conversation_simple.py → Single LLM Call → Response
```
- Single system prompt handles everything
- One LLM call per conversation turn
- Natural conversation flow
- Smart entity merging
- Built-in business logic in prompt

## Core Components

### 1. `simple_api.py` - API Layer
**Purpose**: FastAPI application providing REST endpoints

**Key Features**:
- `/chat` endpoint for conversations
- In-memory conversation storage
- Conversation ID management
- Health check endpoint
- Static file serving for web interface

**Request/Response Flow**:
```python
ChatRequest → process_conversation_turn() → ChatResponse
```

### 2. `conversation_simple.py` - Conversation Engine
**Purpose**: Core conversation processing with single system prompt

**Key Functions**:

#### `process_conversation_turn(messages: List[Dict[str, str]]) -> str`
Main conversation processor that:
1. Analyzes user response with LLM for contextual understanding
2. Extracts entities with smart merging
3. Tracks confirmed entities throughout conversation
4. Generates response using master system prompt

#### `analyze_user_response_with_llm(user_message, assistant_message, entities) -> Dict`
Uses LLM to understand user responses:
- Detects confirmations (positive/negative/neutral)
- Extracts confirmed values from context
- Identifies new information provided
- Determines if user needs clarification

#### `extract_entities(messages: List[Dict]) -> Dict[str, Any]`
Extracts mortgage information from conversation:
- Down payment and property price
- Location with geographic inference
- Boolean fields (passport, visa, income, reserves)
- Handles exploratory language and questions

#### `smart_merge_entities(current, new, confirmed) -> Dict`
Intelligently merges entity updates:
- Prioritizes confirmed values over extracted values
- Prevents corruption of meaningful data
- Handles financial field updates carefully

#### `calculate_qualification(entities: Dict) -> Dict`
Business logic for pre-qualification:
- Validates 25% minimum down payment
- Checks all required documentation
- Returns qualified/not qualified decision

## System Prompt Architecture

### MASTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT Components

1. **Mission Statement**: Clear objective to pre-qualify users
2. **8 Information Requirements**: Specific data points needed
3. **Conversation Rules**: How to handle questions and changes
4. **Confirmation Protocol**: Universal Answer → Confirm → Proceed
5. **Validation Rules**: Down payment, visa, documentation requirements
6. **Educational Responses**: Standard answers for common questions
7. **Calculation Logic**: Reserve calculations and number formatting
8. **Qualification Rules**: When and how to make decisions

### Universal Confirmation Protocol

**Rule**: After answering ANY question from the user, ask for confirmation before moving to next qualification topic.

**Examples**:
- Exploratory: "how much can I afford?" → Calculate → "Would you like to proceed with $800k?"
- Educational: "what visas work?" → List visas → "Do you have one of these visas?"
- Clarification: "do I need reserves?" → Explain → "Do you have 6-12 months saved?"

## Entity Management System

### Entity Types
```python
{
    "down_payment": int,           # Dollar amount
    "property_price": int,         # Dollar amount  
    "loan_purpose": str,           # "primary residence" | "second home" | "investment"
    "property_city": str,          # City name
    "property_state": str,         # State abbreviation
    "has_valid_passport": bool,    # Documentation
    "has_valid_visa": bool,        # Documentation
    "can_demonstrate_income": bool, # Documentation capability
    "has_reserves": bool           # Financial reserves
}
```

### Smart Merging Logic
1. **Confirmed Entity Priority**: Explicitly confirmed values override everything
2. **Financial Field Protection**: Don't overwrite positive amounts with zero/None
3. **Updated Field Handling**: Handle `updated_down_payment` vs `down_payment`
4. **Geographic Intelligence**: Auto-infer states for known cities

### Confirmation Tracking
```python
confirmed_entities = {}  # Values user explicitly confirmed
```
- Tracks confirmations throughout conversation history
- Prevents confirmed values from being overwritten
- Enables conversation replay with consistent entity state

## Conversation Flow

### 1. First Message
```
User: "I want to apply for a mortgage"
→ Standard greeting + first question (down payment)
```

### 2. Information Gathering
```
User provides answer → Extract entities → Ask next question
```

### 3. Question Handling
```
User asks question → Answer question → Ask for confirmation → Wait for response
```

### 4. Entity Updates
```
User: "actually I want to put down 300k"
→ Update entity → Confirm change → Continue
```

### 5. Final Decision
```
All 8 entities collected + no pending questions → Calculate qualification → Provide decision
```

## Error Handling & Recovery

### Robust Entity Extraction
- Multiple LLM calls with different contexts if needed
- Fallback to previous values if extraction fails
- Confidence scoring for entity updates

### Conversation State Protection
- Confirmed entities can't be accidentally overwritten
- Smart merging prevents data corruption
- Conversation history maintains context

### API Error Handling
- OpenAI API failures return helpful error messages
- Conversation state preserved during errors
- Graceful degradation if LLM unavailable

## Performance Characteristics

### Efficiency Gains (vs v2.0.0)
- **Single LLM Call**: Reduced from 3-5 calls per turn to 1
- **No State Management Overhead**: Eliminated complex graph traversal
- **Simpler Debugging**: One prompt to rule them all
- **Faster Response Times**: Direct conversation processing

### Resource Usage
- **Memory**: In-memory conversation storage (production should use Redis)
- **CPU**: Minimal processing beyond LLM calls
- **API Calls**: 1 OpenAI call per user message (plus optional confirmation analysis)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- `test_simple_api.py`: API endpoint testing
- `test_simple_flow.py`: Conversation flow scenarios
- Individual function testing for entity extraction

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end conversation flows
- Confirmation protocol verification
- Entity persistence testing

### Production Testing
- Live deployment testing on Render
- Real user conversation scenarios
- Performance monitoring

## Deployment Architecture

### Production Stack
```
GitHub → Render Auto-Deploy → Container → FastAPI → OpenAI API
```

### Environment Configuration
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Required for LLM functionality
- Auto-scaling based on traffic
- Health check monitoring
- Static asset serving

## Future Enhancements

### Scalability Improvements

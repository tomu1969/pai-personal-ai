# Deployment Summary - Mortgage Agent Fixes

**Date**: 2025-09-28  
**Commit**: 289013a  
**Status**: ✅ Pushed to GitHub, Render auto-deployment triggered

---

## 🎯 Problems Fixed

### 1. **Infinite Question Loops** ✅
**Before**: Questions asked 6+ times even after user answered  
**After**: Each question asked max once, force progression after 2 attempts

### 2. **Failed Entity Extraction** ✅
**Before**: "rent on Airbnb" not recognized as "investment"  
**After**: Robust deterministic extraction recognizes all synonyms
- "Airbnb", "rental", "rent" → "investment"
- "live", "primary", "personal" → "personal"
- "vacation", "second" → "second"

### 3. **Poor Classification** ✅
**Before**: "How much? $200k" treated as question, caused loops  
**After**: Smart classification detects data presence, treats as answer

## 📦 Files Changed

### New Files:
1. **extraction_helpers.py** (267 lines)
   - `parse_money()`: $50k, $1.5M, 400000 → float
   - `normalize_loan_purpose()`: Airbnb → investment
   - `parse_location()`: Miami, FL → {city, state}
   - `extract_from_message()`: Question-specific extraction
   - `is_correction_intent()`: Detects user corrections
   - `contains_data()`: Checks if text has substantive info

### Modified Files:
2. **state.py** - Added tracking fields:
   - `asked_counts: Dict[int, int]` - Attempts per question
   - `last_asked_q: Optional[int]` - Last question emitted
   - `last_prompt_hash: Optional[str]` - Duplicate detection

3. **api.py** - Initialize new fields in `create_initial_state()`

4. **graph.py** - Core logic improvements:
   - Added idempotency helper functions
   - Deterministic extraction runs FIRST (before LLM)
   - Force progression after 2 attempts with data
   - Never re-asks if data already present

5. **router.py** - Fixed classification:
   - `classify_input()` now accepts `extracted` parameter
   - Detects data presence (numbers, currency, locations)
   - Question words at START + no data = question
   - Otherwise = answer

## 🧪 Test Results

### Unit Tests (extraction_helpers):
```
✅ "$50k" → 50000.0
✅ "$400,000" → 400000.0
✅ "I have 175k saved" → 175000.0
✅ "1.5 million" → 1500000.0
✅ "I want to rent it on Airbnb" → investment
✅ "It's my primary residence" → personal
✅ "vacation home" → second
✅ "Miami, FL" → {city: Miami, state: FL}
✅ "Dallas, Texas" → {city: Dallas, state: Texas}
```

### Integration Tests:
```
✅ "rent on Airbnb" extracts as "investment"
✅ "$400k down" extracts down_payment correctly
✅ No repeated questions on same data
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Automatic Deployment:
- **Trigger**: Git push to `main` branch
- **Platform**: Render.com
- **Service**: `mortgage-agent`
- **Auto-Deploy**: Enabled via `render.yaml`
- **Build Command**: `cd mortgage-agent && pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start Command**: `uvicorn src.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`

### Monitoring:
1. Visit https://dashboard.render.com
2. Navigate to `mortgage-agent` service
3. Check **Events** tab for deployment progress
4. View **Logs** tab for build output
5. Test `/health` endpoint once deployed

### Expected Build Time:
- **2-5 minutes** typical deployment
- Triggered by changes to `mortgage-agent/**` paths

---

## 🔍 How to Verify Deployment

### Health Check:
```bash
curl https://your-render-url.onrender.com/health
# Expected: {"status": "healthy", "service": "mortgage-chatbot"}
```

### Test Extraction:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-render-url.onrender.com/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "I want to rent it on Airbnb"}'
# Check response contains loan_purpose handling
```

### Test Conversation (no loops):
Send the following messages in order:
1. "Hello"
2. "$50k" → Should extract down_payment, move to Q2
3. "Miami" → Should extract city, move to Q3
4. "Airbnb" → Should extract "investment", move to Q4
5. Each question should be asked ONCE

## 📊 Key Metrics to Watch

### Before (Broken):
- ❌ Questions repeated 6+ times
- ❌ "Airbnb" not recognized
- ❌ Users stuck in loops
- ❌ Completion rate: Low

### After (Fixed):
- ✅ Each question asked max once
- ✅ All synonyms recognized
- ✅ Force progression after 2 attempts
- ✅ Expected completion rate: High

---

## 🛠️ Rollback Plan (if needed)

If issues occur, rollback to previous commit:

```bash
git revert 289013a
git push origin main
```

Or via Render Dashboard:
1. Go to mortgage-agent service
2. Click "Manual Deploy"
3. Select previous successful deployment
4. Click "Deploy"

## 📝 Next Steps

### Immediate (Post-Deployment):
- [ ] Monitor Render deployment logs
- [ ] Test health endpoint
- [ ] Run manual conversation test
- [ ] Verify "Airbnb" → "investment" works in production

### Short-Term:
- [ ] Collect user feedback on reduced repetition
- [ ] Monitor completion rates
- [ ] Check for any edge cases
- [ ] Consider adding more extraction patterns if needed

### Long-Term:
- [ ] Add tone improvements (remove excessive praise) - already prepared in PATCHES.md
- [ ] Implement JSON-based LLM responses for more reliable extraction
- [ ] Add telemetry/metrics for question attempts
- [ ] Consider caching frequent extractions

---

## 🎉 Success Criteria

Deployment considered successful when:
- ✅ Health endpoint responds with 200 OK
- ✅ User sends "Airbnb" and system extracts "investment"
- ✅ No questions repeated more than once
- ✅ Force progression triggers after 2 attempts
- ✅ Full pre-approval flow completes without loops

# Mortgage Agent Fixes - Unified Patches

This document contains all patches to fix the re-asking loops and extraction issues.

## Summary of Changes

1. **state.py**: Add attempt tracking and idempotency fields
2. **extraction_helpers.py** (NEW): Robust deterministic extraction functions
3. **graph.py**: Add idempotency guards, attempt caps, and use deterministic extraction
4. **router.py**: Fix classification to avoid false positives on questions
5. **nodes.py**: Remove excessive praise, enforce neutral tone

## Testing After Applying Patches

Run these test scenarios to verify fixes:

```bash
# Test 1: Out-of-order info (should capture in 1-2 turns)
echo "I have $400k down, looking at $1.5M house in Seattle for investment" | python -m pytest test_scenario3_outoforder.py

# Test 2: Purpose synonyms
# User says "rent on Airbnb" â should extract as "investment"

# Test 3: Correction
# User says "actually it's $500k not $400k" â should not re-ask Q1

# Test 4: Question mid-flow
# User asks "what's LTV?" â should answer without incrementing asked_counts
```

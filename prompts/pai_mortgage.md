Example 1 (English, first-time buyer):

User: I want to buy my first home but don't know where to start
PAI Mortgage: Hi there! Congratulations on taking this exciting step toward homeownership! I'd love to help you get started. 

To give you the best guidance, could you share:
- What's your approximate annual income?
- Do you know your current credit score?
- How much do you have saved for a down payment?
- What price range are you considering?

This will help me determine which loan programs might work best for you and what your next steps should be.

Example 2 (English, specific qualification):

User: I make $75k per year, have a 680 credit score, and $40k saved. Can I qualify for a $350k house?
PAI Mortgage: Great question! With your profile, you're in a solid position for homeownership.

**Your Qualification Snapshot:**
- $350k house with $40k down = $310k loan (89% LTV)
- Estimated monthly payment: ~$2,300 (includes taxes/insurance)
- Payment-to-income ratio: ~37% (within acceptable range)

**You qualify for:**
✅ Conventional loan: ~7.25% rate with your 680 score
✅ FHA loan: ~7.15% rate (though may not be necessary with your down payment)

**Recommendation:** Conventional loan would be ideal - no PMI required with your $40k down payment, and you avoid FHA's ongoing mortgage insurance.

**Next steps:**
1. Get pre-approved with 2-3 lenders to compare rates
2. Budget for closing costs (~$7k-$10k)
3. Start house hunting with confidence!

Would you like help finding pre-approval lenders or have questions about any specific loan program?
